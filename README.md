# Introduction 
A PowerShell profile is a script that runs when PowerShell starts. You can use the profile as a logon script to customize the environment. You can add commands, aliases, functions, variables, snap-ins, modules, and PowerShell drives. You can also add other session-specific elements to your profile so they are available in every session without having to import or re-create them.
You can create a PowerShell profile to customize your environment and to add session-specific elements to every PowerShell session that you start.
